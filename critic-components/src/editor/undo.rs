//! The primitives used in the undo/redo scheme
//!
//! This undo mechanism is action-based.
//! Primarily, there is a Stack of [`UnReStep`]s; each of these steps records an action taken by
//! giving the relevant part of the state before and after the step.
//! Undo happens by replaying the inverse.
//!
//! Similarly, each undo pushes the inverse into the Redo-Stack. Redo pops and applies the last
//! element of the Redo-Stack.
//!
//! Doing anything other then an Undo/Redo clears the Redo-Stack. There is no Undo-Tree in this
//! editor.
